  **SDG 8: Decent Work and Economic Growth** - Promote Sustained, Inclusive and Sustainable Economic Growth, Full and Productive Employment and Decent Work For All
## Problem Statement
![business](https://github.com/JanBii/ATT-FINAL_PROJECT_ALDAY-MAGNAYE-MENDOZA/blob/main/business.png)

  Women who want to start their own businesses in rural areas must overcome a number of challenges. Obstacles to their mobility and participation in economic activities include limited access to education, training, financial resources, and cultural and social standards. The gender disparity in entrepreneurship and economic empowerment is greatly influenced by these elements.
  
## Significance of the Proposed Study
  In order to address demographic shifts, inform policy choices, encourage inclusive employment practices, improve workforce planning, support economic growth, facilitate social welfare, and facilitate comparative analysis, it is crucial to conduct research on the relationship between age and employment in Southeast Asia. The results could lead to improvements in hiring procedures and contribute to the general growth and well-being of Southeast Asian people and cultures.
