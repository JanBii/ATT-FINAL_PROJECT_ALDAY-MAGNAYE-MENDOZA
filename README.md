## Introduction
  The project intends to investigate the connection between employment and age in Southeast Asia, with an emphasis on understanding the opportunities and constraints experienced by people in various age groups. The study will offer important insights into the employment patterns and trends in the area by evaluating and interpreting data on workforce dynamics.
  
  The SDGs related to this topics are:

  **SDG 8: Decent Work and Economic Growth** - Promote Sustained, Inclusive and Sustainable Economic Growth, Full and Productive Employment and Decent Work For All
## Problem Statement

  Despite the increasing focus on inclusive employment policies, Southeast Asia still has a long way to go before it can guarantee opportunities for people in all age groups. It is necessary to have a greater grasp of the connection between age and work because of the region's various demographics and changing labour market characteristics. Age-inclusive practices cannot be developed due to insufficient research and ineffective policy initiatives, which has an adverse effect on job outcomes and the potential of people of all ages. Investigating the obstacles, chances, and solutions that can improve age-inclusive employment in Southeast Asia is therefore urgently needed. Stakeholders can work toward establishing an inclusive workforce that honors and makes use of the abilities and experiences of people from young to old by addressing these gaps.
